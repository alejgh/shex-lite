Abstract:
  ShEx Lite is a lightweight version of ShEx that has as an aim reduce the complexity of the syntax, improve the semactic analisis of the schemas and boost the performance of the validation process.

  One of the restrictions of the language is that it represents a subset of ShEx. Therefore any source code developed in shex-lite format will be completly compatible with ShEx implementations. But although it is inspired in those ShEx implementations it is a complete independent language, it has its own syntax, semantics, features, compiler and validation process.
